# Translator API

This is a Translator API that utilizes the LLM3 model to provide language translation and spelling correction capabilities. The API is built using FastAPI in Python.

## Features

- Language Translation: The API allows you to translate text from one language to another using the powerful LLM3 model.
- Spelling Correction: It also provides the ability to correct spelling errors in the input text.

## Usage

To use the Translator API, you need to send a POST request to the appropriate endpoint with the following parameters:

- `text`: The text that you want to translate or correct.
- `source_language`: The language of the input text. (optional)
- `target_language`: The language to which you want to translate the text. (optional)

Example Request:

```python
import requests

url = "http://translator-api.com/translate"

payload = {
    "text": "Hello, how are you?",
    "source_language": "en",
    "target_language": "fr"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)

print(response.json())
```

Example Response:

```json
{
    "translated_text": "Bonjour, comment Ã§a va?"
}
```
